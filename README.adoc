This is the DevCluster Service repository

== Build

Requires Go (version 1.14 or higher) - download for your development environment https://golang.org/dl/[here].

This repository uses https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules[Go modules]

To build, execute:

```
make build
```

This builds the executable with bundled assets. Only the binary needs to be deployed, all static assets are bundled with the binary.

To just generate the asset bundle, execute:

```
make generate
```

This creates the asset bundle in the `static` package. Do not change the asset bundle file(s), changes will be lost on the next build.

== Development

To make development on the static content easier, a development binary can be built using:

```
make build-dev
```

The resulting binare *does not use bundled assets* but reads static content directly from `pkg/assets`. *Do not deploy the dev binary*. 



=== Tests

==== Unit Tests

Run the unit tests by executing:

```
make test
```

==== Integration Tests

Integration tests require access to a test MongoDB database.

Set `DEVCLUSTER_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable to your test MongoDB:
```
export DEVCLUSTER_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING="<connection_string>"
```

Run the integration tests by executing:

```
make test-integration
```


Tests are run with bundled assets, see above.

==== All Tests

Run all the integration and unit tests by executing:

```
make test-all
```

=== VSCode Testing/Debugging

To use the internal test runner and debug features of VSCode, you need to make sure that VSCode runs in a context where Go Modules are enabled. To do this, run:

```
export GO111MODULE=on
```

Before running VSCode from that shell.

=== Deploying on OpenShift

To deploy the service on OpenShift you need to have OpenShift cluster running and access to a docker registry.
Before running any make target, make sure you have `QUAY_NAMESPACE` variable set to your quay username (or set to any namespace you want to push the image to).

```bash
$ export QUAY_NAMESPACE=<quay-username>
```

Set the target namespace:
```bash
$ export NAMESPACE=<Namespace-to-be-used-to-deploy-devcluster>
```

Then:

* Make sure the target OpenShift cluster is accessible via `oc` command.
* Log in to the target OpenShift cluster with with a user who has edit permissions in `$NAMESPACE` or has permissions to create `$NAMESPACE`
* Login to quay.io via `docker login quay.io` (in case you want to use quay as the docker registry)

Then run:
```bash
make deploy
```

NOTE: If running in CodeReady Containers `eval $(crc oc-env)` is required.
